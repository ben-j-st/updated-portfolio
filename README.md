# updated-portfolio

## Description 

updating my existing portfolio, based on my new experiences and with all the new skills i have acquired over the last several weeks, to improve both the functionality of the portfolio, its reliance on css frameworks, and its style. I belive it showcases a much cleaner professional look than version 1.0 

## Breakdown

I had a bit of fun with project going back over what i had accomplished only a few short weeks ago, its gratifying to know that im making progress even though on the day to day stuff it might not seem like it just yet, but with projects like this it offerers definitive proof. i cant wait for the next 15/20 weeks and what i can do once i improve even more and i look forward to being able to showcase that in the weeks to come.
