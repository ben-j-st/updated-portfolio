            Having just completed high school I was keen for a break for a year to earn some money, when I brought this
            decision to my mother's attention this idea was quickly shot down. So back to school I went, where I went
            through a few years of tafe and uni struggling to stay motivated and committed to the courses that I was
            doing.

            Over the last several years I have been a personal trainer and group fitness instructor, I found early in
            life that one of my big passions was keeping fit and active, having done years of kung fu and football and
            various other sports. So when it came time to pursue a career path, one of my options was fitness.

          <h2>Future</h2>
          <p>
            When I think about the future, I look forward to a career that continues to keep me interested and
            challenged for years to come, where every day brings with it a little adventure and discovery, some new
            project or role to remind me why I love computers and why I choose to pursue a career in IT.
